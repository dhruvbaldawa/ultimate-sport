When you are living in an Indian city, finding a field to play is a big deal.
A real big deal. It hurts to not have your disc with you, when you have access
to a lush green field, but don't have a disc to play with!  Always carry it!
[If you care about your clothes, carry a pair of shorts and T too!]

On a more serious note, coaches encourage new players to carry around discs to
get used to the disc in the hand [This is why you see kids dribbling their
basketballs everywhere, not just because it looks hip]. But don't just carry
it, squeeze in a few minutes of `deliberate practice`_, if you can, everyday --
something tiny, like switching grips quickly, without using your non-throwing
hand, work on your accuracy, etc.
