I just came across the `news`_ that Piyush Vaghela and Nilesh Solanki, fellow
Ultimate players, lost their lives, struck by a lightning during a practice
session!  My deepest condolonces to their near and dear ones.

I met Piyush at the Surat Ultimate Open and enjoyed playing against him.  We
marked each other on quite a few points, in the game that was my first game in
a tournament.  He played hard, and pushed his team harder!  I vividly remember
him commending me on running hard and catching well.  I later chatted with
him, and was quite impressed with the work he was doing and his dream to give
the kids a platform to get greater exposure, through the sport!  Silent Voice
will surely miss him.

Piyush, may your soul rest in peace! :'(
