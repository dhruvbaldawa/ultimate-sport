Here's a lovely quote from the preface of `Ultimate - Techniques & Tactics
<http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Zvgbmv7OinAC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9>`_ by James
Parinella and Eric Zaslow

    Resolve yourself to becoming a good player. Good players chase down swill.
    Good players clear out.  Good players cut when they're tired. Good players
    remember the defense. Good players call for help when they need it. In
    fact, "good" players are great players. Great teams also require great
    teammates. Become a great teammate. Be ready to play on time. Critique but
    don't criticize your teammates. Apologize for your mistakes. Take yourself
    out of the game when you're tired. Eschew pride.
