I came across `this nicely written post`_ on the importance of practice
sessions for a team.  Many of the points discussed are very common in
discussions of our team, and possibly most other Ultimate teams, but it's nice
to read it all at once place, written clearly and convincingly. It also comes
with some interesting and inspiring videos!

Summary:

- Throws: Every practice session should start with a lot of throwing.

- Drills: do them as if your life depended on them

- Fitness: Work on it yourself and with your team; Work on everything - speed,
  agility, power, strength

- Strategy: Try out a lot of things.  Keep learning

- Play: There's no substitute to actual game time.
