`Pankaj <http://github.com/pankajp>`_ and I came up with a fun throwing and
catching drill, while just fooling around with a couple of discs.  Neither of
us are very experienced players, and nor was this drill scientifically
designed.  We just stumbled upon it, but it seems like it'll help improve a
few things in our game.  Read on.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- a couple of discs
- some place where you can throw the disc around (10-15 yards X 4-6 yards,
  atleast)
- yourself and a partner
- the desire to have some fun!

How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You and your partner stand about 5 yards apart, or any distance at which you
want to improve your throwing/catching.  You start with one person, throwing a
backhand and the other person flicking forehand.  Both of you throw the disc
at the same time, and try to throw so that the discs collide mid-air, and then
try to catch the disc your partner has thrown at you. Once you catch the disc,
throw it back, as quickly as possible.  After a few throws, you switch the
throwing side (forehand-backhand). Repeat for as long as you are having fun!
I never tried it, but trying it with hammers might be super-fun!

Benefits of the drill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- By trying to get the two discs to collide, you try to consistently get your
  disc to travel along the same trajectory, effectively trying to repeat the
  same throw. The consistency of your throws improves, given that you have
  already got your basic technique right.

- With your partner and yourself throwing discs at the same time, this drill
  hopefully helps you get rid of the habit of watching your own throws. You
  could possibly improvise and modify the drill a little to get each other to
  take a few steps in a specific direction, to get used to moving your feet
  immediately after releasing the disc.

- Since you are quickly throwing and releasing, you don't really have much
  time to "think" about your throwing or catching.  Once you have done enough
  of other drills to get a proper catching or throwing technique, this drill
  will help you do it subconsciously, instead of thinking about getting it
  right. I find this quite helpful.

- Also, trying to catch the disc after it hits the disc that you threw,
  hopefully teaches you to react quickly, and get used to catching wobbly
  discs that have been knocked around by your defenders.

- Finally, this drill is a lot more fun, than other throwing and catching
  drills, I've been introduced to, until now.
