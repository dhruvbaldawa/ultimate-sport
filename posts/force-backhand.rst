I need to practice forcing backhand, since we don't do it too often.

.. TEASER_END

In general, our team forces flick/forehand, because it's a harder
throw (for beginners) than the backhand throw.  But, advanced players
usually seem to have as good a forehand flick, if not better, than the
backhand.  We were practicing forcing backhand, yesterday.  As
expected, our marks were not as good as they were, when we were
forcing forehand.  I was marking on the wrong side on a couple of
occasions, and the mess-up lead to our opposition scoring, pretty
easily. But, surprisingly, even our opposition seemed not ready to be
forced backhand and took a while to adjust to the mark!

Anyway, I realized it helps a lot to remind myself what the mark is,
at the start of every point, and to translate that to, me facing
home/away.  Since the flick is a quicker throw than the backhand, when
forcing backhand, we should be standing a little more towards the
break-side than we would be if we were forcing flick -- our right
shoulder in line with their right shoulder (assuming the thrower is
right-handed).
