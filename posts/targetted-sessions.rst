First things first, the new season begins tomorrow! Yay! I've really had
enough of off-season for this season.

This season, every game, I'm going to go with one thing that I want to work on
for each of offense and defense.  I'm going to stick with it, for as long as I
need to.  Until, I'm satisfied.

Defense: Mark better.  Move my feet more than what I do.  Be on the move,
while on the mark, rather than stand and lean over.  I'll keep posting on
things I discover, and try to make it "measurable".

Offense: `"Just catch!" <http://www.ultimaterob.com/2013/08/22/just-catch/>`_.
I'm going to get more natural while catching, and not get very conscious about
the mechanics.  I think the mechanics need to be fixed during practice, but in
the game, I need to just catch!  Focus on attacking the disc, and getting it
before your opponent or before it hits the ground.  Simple.

Have a good season, folks!  Cheers!
