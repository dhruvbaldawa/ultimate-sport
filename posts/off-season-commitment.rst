The new season of Ultimate has just begun, and most of the players are
noticeably rusty -- running slower, not able to get to the right place
at the right time, rusty throws, etc.

Even if you don't get a chance to play Ultimate,

- Build strength; at the very least, keep fit.
- Think about Ultimate, talk it, watch it, read it, visualize it, ...
  Just thinking about the game, I *feel*, helps...
