In Tuesday's match, I got a couple of good D's, or so I thought, until
I saw that the discs that I smacked away, didn't actually go crashing
into the ground, but instead just slowed down and became easy catches
for the guys that I D-ed.

Both the discs were "catchable", and I think I should've caught them.
To make sure that your disc crashes right into the ground, you need to
time your smack, and direct it correctly, and make sure you've enough
power in your smack; and you already trying to time your jump, to get
to the disc before your opponent!  Adding one more level of complexity
doesn't really help, does it?  Catching is something we are practicing
all the time, and when the disc is catchable, I think it's best to let
it stick into your hand, instead of trying to smack it down, and
failing and giving the opponents a chance to catch the disc.
