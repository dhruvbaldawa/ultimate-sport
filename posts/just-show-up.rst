"Where the @#@#@ is your commitment?" -- our captain.

If you want to be a top player, a top team, you have no other option
but to practice as hard, with as much commitment as you can.  There's
no two ways about it.

Even if you are the only one in a practice session, it doesn't matter.
There are surely things, that you can work on your own upon.  Show up
and Practice hard!  Set yourself `goals

and work towards them.  Make yourself a training routine.  Do whatever
it takes, to get better as an individual player, and as a team!
