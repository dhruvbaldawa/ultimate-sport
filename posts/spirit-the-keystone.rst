Spirit of the Game (SOTG) is rule #1 of the game.  Ultimate relies on
a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility of fair play on
every player.

.. TEASER_END

Unlike any other sport, Ultimate is self refreed at the highest levels
of the game, and this demands a strong sense of sportsmanship and
responsibility from each one of the players.

Apart from the intensity of the game, and the joy it brings to see the
disc speed down the field and being grabbed from the air by a soaring
player, the spirit with which the game is played is one of the things
I love about the game.  I've been lucky to have been associated with a
club that respects the SOTG and has been consistently recognized for
that, in various tournaments.

The spirit of the game is not about not calling fouls.  It's not about
playing a less intense game, and to give away some easy plays to your
opponent.  The spirit is about respect - respect for the sport, the
rules, your opponent and yourself.  The spirit is about mental
toughness, and integrity.  It's about being consistent on your calls,
no matter what the score line reads.  It's about courage, and
character.  Enough said.  The spirit, will mean different things to
different people.  But it's something that makes me proud of being an
Ultimate player.  It is what brings joy, to all the intensity in the
game!

Unlike other sports, the spirit (of sportsmanship) is not a
guideline.  It's in the rule book, and is the #1 rule.  I think, this
is a very important thing to be taught to the new players, specially
those coming from other sports, where bending the rules when nobody
is watching is an accepted part of the culture.

At a recent tournament, I had the chance to be a part of post-game
spirit circles, where teams discuss each others' game including how to
better adhere to the SOTG.  It's a very special experience and nothing
like anything I've been a part of before.  I've had goosebumps, just
watching the spirit circles of some of the other games!

Enough said.  Now, go read the `WFDF Rule`_ #1.  And `this edition`_ of
Huddle, for more on what some great Ultimate players think about the
Spirit.
