This site was started by a bunch of people, who fell in love with
Ultimate.  The idea is to have a site where we ramble about Ultimate,
and put up anything Ultimate.  We are hoping to have a lot of fun
here, while we share our experiences and tips & techniques to become
better Ultimate players.

If you wish to contribute, either send a pull request on `GitHub
<https://github.com/huckerdom/ultimate-sport>`_ or leave a comment `here
</posts/welcome-to-ultimate-sport.html>`_.  If you have nikola installed, use
the ``new_post`` command to generate the empty file, or use copy over the
`post.tmpl </post.tmpl>`_ file to the posts directory with an appropriate
filename and extension.
